Project Overview  Overland Group operates with over 500+ trucks transporting goods in and out of the country. The company currently relies on fragmented systems and Excel-based workflows across multiple departments, including Accounts, HR, IT, Tracking, Clearing, Operations, Admin, and Workshop.  This has led to inefficient operations, data silos, human errors, and delayed decision-making.  The proposed solution is to build a centralized, cloud-based, mobile-friendly Business Management System that:  * Consolidates operations into one platform * Integrates with real-time GPS tracking systems * Connects seamlessly with Smartsheet for advanced task & project management * Supports AI-driven reporting, alerts, and automation * Eliminates dependency on manual Excel files  ### 2. Objectives  * Centralize and automate operations across all departments * Enable advanced fleet and project tracking * Improve cross-department collaboration * Implement automated alerts, task assignments, and approvals * Integrate Smartsheet for seamless project/task workflows * Use AI for predictive analytics, decision-making, and reporting  ### 3.
